##  Shiny Presentation
This is an example of shiny presentation. 
It is created for Developing Data Products Course Project.


## The 'Pitch' 
Motivation for this project was Venables and Ripley's work on use of R/S-PLUS in
Applied Statistics. In particular their analytics of estimating the frequency of geyser
erruptions.
CRAN has recently implemented a new package 'MASS' that has all the functions needed
to support this work.  


## An overview of the shiny presentation

In the next slid of an interactve plot, we prsent the density estimation of 
continuous variables illustrated in this work while using some of the shiny
features such as a slider for the bandwidth.

- The rule of thumb for bandwidth is assumed to be:
(max(eruptions)-min(eruptions))/(2*(1+log(length(eruptions),base=2)))

- dataset('oldfaithful')

- library(MASS) 



## Slide with Interactive Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```
